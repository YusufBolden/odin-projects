### Classic schoolyard game - Rock Paper Scissors

This project requires creating an browser-based implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The history of the game and how to play it can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

## How the code script works

The user will play against the computer. For each user play, the user will click on the icon for rock, paper or scissors, and the code script will randomly select a play of rock, paper or scissors for the computer.
